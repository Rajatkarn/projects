- html is case-insensitive language.
DOCTYPE refers to the version of html(html5)
To format the html code use alt+shift+F
We use some tags just for the semantics like h1,2,3,4,5,6 or header, footer and so on.

<img src="11.jpg"></a>)
entities having starting and ending are containers and the entities that do not have an end are called empty.
Structure of html page:
header:<header>
navigation bar:<nav>{used to describe menu bar}
main content:<main> with various content subsections represented by <article>,<section>,<div> elements.
sidebar:<aside>{placed inside <main>}
footer: <footer>
border: 2px solid black{this is called short-hand technique.}
color patterns used in css: rgb, rgba, #rgb, #rrggbb.
to calculate width, formula is {width calc(90%-15px)}.
instead of float we generally use flexbox and grid for layout purpose.
!important is used in rare cases. We usually go with priority{inline-(internal-external)}.
